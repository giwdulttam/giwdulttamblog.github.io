Hello! I'm Matt, an incoming PhD student in statistics at Boston Univeristy. I am primarily interested in non-commutative probability theory and its combinatorial aspects. In particular, I am interested in its interactions with stochastic processes and random matrix theory. Below are a handful of posts on these things. Feel free to contact me with any questions, concerns or comments at maludwig15@gmail.com.
