Hello! I'm Matt, a first year masters student in statistics at Boston Univeristy. I'm currently interested in the subject of free probability theory and its interactions with stochastic processes, random matrices and operator algebras. When not thinking about math, I enjoy listening to music, playing cello and going to concerts with friends. Feel to contact me with any comments and questions or just to say hello!
