### Group von Neumann Algebras


We first recall that a vector space $\mathcal{H}$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is called a Hilbert space if it is equipt with an inner product and is complete in the topology induced by the norm associated with the inner product. Further recall that a bounded operator on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-linear map $x: \mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}$ such that: $$sup_{\zeta \in \mathcal{H}} \frac{\| \| x \zeta \| \|}{\| \| \zeta \| \|} < \infty $$ and this supremum is called the operator norm of the operator $x$ and is denoted $\lvert \lvert x \rvert \rvert$.

Also recall that the adjoint of the operator $x$, denoted $x^{\star}$, is the unique bounded operator determined by $< x \zeta, \eta > = < \zeta, x^* \eta >$ where $\zeta, \eta \in \mathcal{H}$.  Now note that the set of bounded operators on $\mathcal{H}$ denoted by $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is a $\star$-algebra 

Recall that a $\star$-algebra is a Banach algebra (that is an associative algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ that is at the same time a Banach space (that is a normed space that is complete in the metric induced by the nrorm) together with an involution satisfying the properties of the adjoint where multiplication is given by composition. Also note since $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is closed under the operation of norm and for all $x \in \mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ we have that $\| \| x^{\star} x \| \| = \| \| x \| \|^{2} = \| \| x^{\star} \| \|^2$, then $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is a $C^{star}$-algebra.
