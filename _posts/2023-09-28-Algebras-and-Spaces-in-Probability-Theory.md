### Algebras and Spaces in Probability Theory




In classical probability theory, one often begins with a 



Note: Any unital commutative $C^* -$algebra can be realized as the algebra of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space $\Omega(A)$ in an essentially unique way. 

This leads to the following: $\Omega \rightarrow A(\Omega)$ and $A \rightarrow \Omega(A)$ are contravariantly functorial and set up a dual equivalence between the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and the category of unital commutative $C^* -$algebras. 

One consequence of this fact is that...
