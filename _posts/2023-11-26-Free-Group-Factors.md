### Free Group Factors


The concept of freeness originated from the study of von Neumann algebras related to free groups. In this post we will discuss the connection between free groups, von Neumann algebras and free probability theory.

We recall the notion of a group von Neumann algebra.

A group von Neumann algebra is defined as....




Now recal that the free product of two groups $G$ and $H$ is denoted by $G \star H$ and is defined to be the group with generating set that is the disjiont union of $G$ and $H$ and whose relations are only those inherited from $G$ and $H$ and which identifies the identity elements of $G$ and $H$. 

Observe that the free product of $\mathbb{Z} \star ... \star \mathbb{Z} = \mathbb{F_n}$. Now, we would like to understand the von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{L}(\mathbb{F_n})$ and will use the notions of freeness and free independence.
