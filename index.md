Hello! I'm Matt, an incoming PhD student in statistics at Boston Univeristy. I am broadly interested in probability theory, stochastic modeling and functional analysis. I am particularly interested in the application of these fields to anomoly detection, uncertainty quantification and robust machine learning. 

I also enjoy dabbling in operator algebras and non-commutative probabilty theory and its combinatorial aspects. Below are a handful of posts on these things. Feel free to contact me with any questions, concerns or comments at maludwig15@gmail.com.
