### What are Cumulants?



In statistics and probability, quantitative measures called moments are typically used to shape of a distribution. The most commonly encountered moments are the first and second central moments which are typically 
referred to as the mean and variance of a distribution. The useful thing about moments is that not only do they describe the shape of a distribution, but they also uniquely determine it. In particular, if two 
distributions have the same collection of moments, then they are the same distribution. In order to keep track of the list of moments for a distribution, it is convient to "string them up on a clothes line" or
display them with the help of a moment generating function. The moment generating function is defined as $\mathbb{E}[e^{Xt}]$
