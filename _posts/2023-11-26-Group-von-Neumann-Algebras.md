### Group von Neumann Algebras


We first recall that a vector space $\mathcal{H}$ over $\mathbb{C}$ is called a Hilbert space if it is equipt with an inner product and is complete in the topology induced by the norm associated with the inner product. Further recall that a bounded operator on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-linear map $x: \mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}$ such that: $$sup_{\zeta \in \mathcal{H}} \frac{\| \| x \zeta \| \|}{\| \| \zeta \| \|} < \infty $$ and this supremum is called the operator norm of the operator $x$ and is denoted $\lvert \lvert x \rvert \rvert$.

Also recall that the adjoint of the operator $x$, denoted $x^{\star}$, is the unique bounded operator determined by $< x \zeta, \eta > = < \zeta, x^* \eta >$ where $\zeta, \eta \in \mathcal{H}$.  Now note that the set of bounded operators on $\mathcal{H}$ denoted by $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is a $\star$-algebra (that is a Banach algebra (which recall a Banach algebra is an associative algebra over $\mathbb{C}$ that is at the same time a Banach space (which recall is a normed space that is complete in the metric induced by the nrorm)) together with an involution satisfying the properties of the adjoint).
