### Algebras and Spaces in Probability Theory


A few interesting notes on probability spaces:



Interesting analogy: 

$C^*$-algebras are to continuous functions as von Neumann algebras are to essentially bounded measurable functions. This correspondence could be thought of as a connection between topological spaces and measure spaces. 


Any unital commutative $C^* -$algebra can be realized as the algebra of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space $\Omega(A)$ in an essentially unique way. 

This leads to the following: $\Omega \rightarrow A(\Omega)$ and $A \rightarrow \Omega(A)$ are contravariantly functorial and set up a dual equivalence between the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and the category of unital commutative $C^* -$algebras.
