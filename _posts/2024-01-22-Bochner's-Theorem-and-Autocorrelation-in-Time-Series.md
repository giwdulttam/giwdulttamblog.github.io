### Bochner's Theorem and Weak-Sense Stationarity


A stochastic process $\{ X_t \}$ is said to be strictly stationary if the cumulative distribution function of the joint distribution of $\{ X_t \}$ at times $t_1 + \tau,...,t_n + \tau$ satisfies: $F_X(x_{t_1 + \tau},...,x_{t_n + \tau} = F_X(x_{t_1},...,x_{t_n})$ for all $\tau,t_1,...,t_n \in \mathbb{R}$ and for all $n \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$ which in other words means that the joint cumulative distribution function for any $n \in \mathhbb{N}$ points does not change if shifted in time. While strict stationarity of a stochastic processes is a nice property, a generalized weaker property called weak-sense or wide-sense stationarity (WSS) of stochastic processes is useful in that allows them to viewed within the context of Hilbert spaces. 

Before discussing how WSS processes can be viewed in the context of Hilbert spaces, I will first introduce Bochner's theorem which states: 

For any normalized continuous positive-definite function $f$ on a locally compact abelian group $G$ with dual group $\hat{G}$, there exists a unique probability measure $\mu$ on $\hat{G}$ such that: $f(g) = \int_{\hat{G}}\zeta(g)d\mu(\zeta)$ or that $f$ is the fourier transform of a unique probability measure $\mu$ on $\hat{G}$. 

Recall that a function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ is called positive semi-definite if for any $x_1,...,x_n \in \mathbb{R}$, the matrix $A = (a_{ij})^{n}_{i,j=1}$ where $a_{ij} = f(x_i - x_j)$ is a positive semi-definite matrix.
