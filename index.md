Hello! I'm Matt, a first year masters student in statistics at Boston Univeristy. I'm currently interested in the subject of free probability theory and its interactions with stochastic processes. Below are a handful of posts about some of the things I am interested in. Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns at maludwig15@gmail.com.
