### Improving a Bound on the Spectral Radius


In this post, I will introduce Bourguin and Peccati's paper "Semicircular Limits on the Free Poisson Chaos: Counterexamples to a Transfer Principle" and improve their spectral bound in (3.13) by showing that it satisfy the basic continuity property.... I will do this by showing that the minimal number of blocks of a partition in NC≥02([2mq],π∗) strictly increases as an affine function of m. This extension follows from their Remark 3.6 reproduced below:
