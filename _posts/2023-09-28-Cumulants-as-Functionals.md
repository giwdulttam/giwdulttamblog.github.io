### Cumulants as Functionals




Having previously introduced cumulants as well as free and monotone cumulants, this post will provide another more general way of viewing cumulants. Mainly, as viewing them as functionals on probability measures. Let $X$ be a set with a $\sigma-$algebra $\mathcal{A}$ and let $Prob(X)$ denote the set of all probability measures on $\mathcal{A}$, that is the set of all functions $\mu: \mathcalA} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $\mu(X) = 1$. Now $Prob(\mathbb{R})$ is a semigroup with the binary operation of convolution operation defined by $(f \star g)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(\tau)g(t - \tau)d\tau$. 


One interesting fact is that if $\mu$ and $\gamma$ are probability measures on the topological group $(\mathbb{R},+)$, then the convolution $\mu \star \gamma$ is a probability distribution of $X + Y$ where $X$ has distribution $\mu$ and $Y$ has distribution $\gamma$.
