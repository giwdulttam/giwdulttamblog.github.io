Hello! I'm Matt, a statistics graduate student at Boston Univeristy.




I study probability theory and am interested in the subject of free probability theory and its interactions with stochastic processes, random matrices and operator algebras. Below there is an assemblage of posts which introduce the subject and track my journey into the weeds of it. When not thinking about mathematics, I enjoy listening to music and playing cello, swing dancing and going to concerts with friends. Feel to contact me with any comments, questions or concerns or just to say hello!
