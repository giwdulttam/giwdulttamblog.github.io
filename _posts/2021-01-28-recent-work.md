### Improving a Bound on the Spectral Radius


In this post, I will introduce Bourguin and Peccati's paper "Semicircular Limits on the Free Poisson Chaos: Counterexamples to a Transfer Principle" and improve their spectral bound in (3.13) by showing that it satisfy the basic continuity property.... I will do this by showing that the minimal number of blocks of a partition in NC≥02([2mq],π∗) strictly increases as an affine function of m. This extension follows from their Remark 3.6 reproduced below: 


Remark 3.6:

Albeit largely sufficient for our needs, the spectral bound (\ref{eq:spectral_bound}) is not satisfying, in particular because the quantity $\max\{1,DK\}$ is not converging to zero whenever $DK \rightarrow 0$. By inspection of the forthcoming proof, one sees that, in order to obtain a spectral bound verifying such a basic continuity property, one would need to show that the minimal number of blocks of a partition in $NC^{0}_{\geq 2([2mq],\pi_*)}$ strictly increases as an affine function of $m$ (in the proof, we use the trivial bound: $|\sigma| \geq q$ for every $\sigma \in  NC^{0}_{\geq 2([2mq],\pi_*))}$. We prefer to think of this issue as a separate problem, and we leave it open for further research.


Before doing this, I will first provide an overview of their work and an introduction to the subject.
