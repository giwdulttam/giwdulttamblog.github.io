Hello! I'm Matt, an incoming PhD student in statistics at Boston Univeristy. I am interested in free probability theory and its interactions with random matrices, operator algebras and stochastic processes. 
Below are a handful of posts on these things. Feel free to contact me with any questions, concerns or comments at maludwig15@gmail.com.
